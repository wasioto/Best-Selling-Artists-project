# Best-Selling-Artists-project

There are 120 best selling music artists of all time. Analyze how many musicians, by country, are listed as Best Selling Artists. The data source comes from : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kabhishm/best-selling-music-artists-of-all-time

Why? There are 120 best selling music artists of all time listed. I want to determine what countries they come from, and how many.

What am I looking for? Analyze how many musicians, by country, are listed as best selling artists.

How to determine this? First I dropped columns that were not needed (period_active, year, & TCU).

Then I filtered to see how many of those 120 artists were from the United States ( 79 out of 120), then calculated the mean, median, & sum of the per million the United States artists made.

Next I filtered to see how many artists were from other countries (41), then created a bar chart showing how many artists were from the United States and the other countries. The use of a line plot was too chaotic for analysis.

Conclusion: Out of 120 best selling music artists, 79 are from the United States while 20 are from the United Kingdom. Canada is in third with approximately 5 best selling artists with all the other countries less than 5. There are also 3 countries that are combined with the United States (US & UK, UK & US, Canada & US, United Kingdom & Australia respectfully) in the bar graph.

Summary: In conclusion, based on this best selling artist list, the majority of them are from the United States (approximately 65%). American popular music began in the 1840s (prior to that popular music was brought over from the UK and other countries) so it would seem most likely, based on this finding, that the majority of best selling artists would be from the United States.

Recommendations for further analysis would be to determine the mean, median, & sum of the per million for the artists from other countries as well. Also analyze solo artists vs group artists, male artists vs female artists and to break down the genre to see which genre (rock & roll, country, r&b, etc) would be the best selling artists.
